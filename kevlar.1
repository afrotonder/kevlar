.SH NAME
kevlar - reference-free variant discovery in large eukaryotic genomes 
.SH SYNOPSIS
 kevlar [-h] [-v] [-l F] [--tee] COMMAND [command options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Welcome to kevlar, software for predicting de novo genetic variants without mapping reads to a reference genome! 
kevlar's k-mer abundance based method calls single nucleotide variants (SNVs), multinucleotide variants (MNVs), 
insertion/deletion variants (indels), and structural variants (SVs) simultaneously with a single simple model. 
This software is free for use under the MIT license.
.SH OPTIONS
-h,   --help       shows original manual, no COMMAND needed.

-v,   --version    show program's version number and exit.

-l F, --logfile F  log file for diagnostic messages, warnings, and errors

--tee              write diagnostic output to logfile AND terminal (stderr)

.SH COMMANDS

kevlar uses subcommands to manage genomic data. All of kevlar's subcommands are listed below, each with its respective options.


alac: Assemble partitioned reads, localize to the reference genome, align the assembled 
      contig to the reference, and call variants.

augment: Internally, kevlar annotates sequences with “interesting k-mers” and uses “augmented” Fastq and Fasta formats. 
         Processing sequences with third-part tools usually requires discarding these annotations. This command is used
         to augment/reaugment a set of sequences using annotations from an already augmented sequence file.

.B      ==CASE/CONTROL CONFIG 

        Specify input files, as well as thresholds for selecting “interesting” k-mers. 
        A single pass is made over input files for control samples (to compute k-mer abundances), 
        while two passes are made over input files for case samples (to compute k-mer abundances, 
        and then to identify “interesting” k-mers). The k-mer abundance computing steps can be skipped 
        if pre-computed k-mer abunandances are provided using the “–case-counts” and/or “–control-counts” settings. 
        If “–control-counts” is declared, then all “–control” flags are ignored. 
        If “–case-counts” is declared, FASTA/FASTQ files must still be provided with 
        “–case” for selecting “interesting” k-mers and reads.

                total memory allocated to k-mer abundance for each sample [default: 1M] ; 
                ignored when pre-computed k-mer abundances are supplied via counttable ;

                terminate if the expected false positive rate for any sample is higher 
                than the specified FPR [default is 0.2] ;


.B      ==KMER BANDING

        If memory is a limiting factor, it is possible to get a linear decrease in memory consumption
        by running kevlar novel in “banded” mode. Splitting the hashed k-mer space into N bands and 
        only considering k-mers from one band at a time reduces the memory consumption to approximately 
        1/N of the total memory required. This implements a scatter/gather approach in which kevlar 
        novel is run N times, after the results are combined using kevlar filter.

        For each batch, kevlar ignores all k-mers except those whose hash values fall within a 
        specified numerical range (band), reducing the memory required to achieve accurate k-mer counts.

        The kevlar count and kevlar novel commands support k-mer banding, and the kevlar unband command merges 
        novel reads from multiple batches into a single read set suitable for downstream analysis.

        --num-bands	
                number of bands into which to divide the hashed k-mer space
        
        --band	
                a number between 1 and N (inclusive) indicating the band to be processed

partition:  Construct a graph to group reads by shared interesting k-mers. Nodes in the graph represent 
            reads, and edges between a pair of nodes indicate that the two corresponding reads have one 
            or more interesting k-mers in common. Connected components in the undirected graph 
            correspond to distinct variants (or variant-related breakpoints).

.B      ==K-MER COUNT FIES

        Likelihood scores are based on the abundance of alternate allele k-mers in each sample and on 
        the abundance of reference allele k-mers in the reference genome.

        --case
        	k-mer counttable for case/proband ;

        --controls
        	k-mer counttables for controls/parents/siblings, 1 counttable per sample ;

        --refr	
                k-mer smallcounttable for reference genome ;

.B      ==K-MER COUNT THRESHOLDS

        The thresholds originally used to detect novel k-mers are used at this stage
        to distinguish true variants from spurious predictions.

        --ctrl-max	
                maximum abundance threshold for controls [default: 1] ;

        --case-min	
                minimum abundance threshold for proband [default: 6] ;

.B      ==K-MER COVERAGE 

        Likelihood scores also depend on the estimated or observed distribution of k-mer abundances in each sample.

        --mu	
                mean k-mer abundance [default: 30.0] ;

        --sigma	
                standard deviation of k-mer abundance [default: 8.0] ;

        --epsilon
        	error rate; default is 0.001 ;

.B      ==HEURISTIC FILTERS

        The following heuristic filters can improve accuracy when calling de novo variants but may 
        require tuning for your particular data set.

        --ctrl-abund-high
                a variant call will be filtered out if either of the control samples has >H high abundance k-mers 
                spanning the variant (where high abundance means > –ctrl-max); [default: H=4; set H<=0 to disable the filter] ;

        --case-abund-low
                a variant call will be filtered out if the case sample has L or more consecutive low abundance k-mers 
                spanning the variant (where low abundance means < –case-min) [default: L=5; set L<=0 to disable the filter]

        --min-like-score
                filter out variant predictions with likelihood scores < S; by default, S = 0.0, but it’s often possible to 
                improve specificity without sacrificing sensitivity by raising S to, for example, 50.0

        --drop-outliers
                discard terminal variant-spanning k-mers with abunance much higher than average (representing k-mers that 
                should be in the reference genome but are not); this will increase sensitivity, but will potentially introduce 
                many false calls as well ;
                
        --ambig-thresh	discard contigs that result in > A distinct, equally optimal variant calls; 
                         [default: A = 10; set A=0 to disable this filter] ;

.B      ==MISC.

        --sample-labels
                list of sample labels (with case/proband first) ;

        -f, --fast-mode
                whenever possible, stop computations prematurely for any putative variants that have already been filtered out ;

        -o, --out
        	output file; default is terminal (standard output) ;

unband: When kevlar is run in k-mer banding mode, the same read will typically appear in multiple
        output files, annotated with a different set of potentially novel k-mers in each case. 
        This command will consolidate these duplicated records across files into a single non-redundant 
        set of reads with the complete set of novel k-mer annotations.

.B      =USAGE

                kevlar unband [-h] [-n N] [-o FILE] infile [infile ...]
        
        infile
        	input files in augmented Fasta/Fastq format ;

        -n, --n-batches
                number of batches into which records will be split [default: 16] ; 
                N temporary files are created and each record from the input is written 
                to a temporary file based on its read name; then each batch is loaded into 
                memory and duplicate records are resolved ;

        -o, --out	
                output file; default is terminal (stdout)
